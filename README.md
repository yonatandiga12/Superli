# Superli-project :truck:
Created a supermarket system for the course "Designing and planing software systems".

Me and my partner were in charge of the "Suppliers" component (end to end). 
Including all the work in this componenet in DAL layer, Business, Service and Presentation.
The project was done in Milestones : first we did only business layer and a simple CLI, than we added database and finally we added WEB presentation.
